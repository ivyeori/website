# react-dynamic-title

The hook react-dynamic-title is used to make the title of our React application dynamic.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://nodejs.org/) to install react-dynamic-title.

```bash
npm install react-dynamic-title
```

or

```bash
yarn add react-dynamic-title
```

## Usage

```javascript
import React from "react";
import useTitle from "react-dynamic-title";

export default function Foo() {
  useTitle("Foo");
  return <div>Foo</div>;
}
```

After that the title will be **Foo | React app**. If you want to remove the second part, just remove the innerHTML of title tag from index.js in forlder "public".
then, the title will be like: **Foo**.

If you want to preserve the title of a unMounting componet, just pass a true value as second argument, like:

```javascript
useTitle("Foo", true);
```

If you like to change the divider **|** by anything else, just pass it as third argument, and make sure that is the third argument, otherwise it will become second and preserve the title of unMounting component.

```javascript
useTitle("Foo", false, "&");
```

title will be like: **Foo & React App**.
If you didn't pass it, the default divider ' **|** ' will displayed.

## Conclusion

This is my first package. While creating a React app, I am wondering how to make the title dynamic, thus I made a hook for it. It's a hook that I'm uploading because I think someone else will find it useful. Some components for the same purpose came to my attention, but I ignored them because I believed the hook would be simple to manage more. Finally, I humbly say, there is a lot of room for error. So let me know your feedbacks.
